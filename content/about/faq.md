**Is this content really free? Are there any limitations?**

Yes, I offer this as an effort to educate people for free. However, there are some fair usage limitations:

- No monetization. You are not permitted to monetize this content or profit directly from the book itself.
- No modifications without consent. You may not alter or adapt the content for any purpose without prior approval.

**Will there be a PDF or e-book version of this threat hunting book?**

Due to the nature of the project, formats other than HTML/Markdown are not possible because of the release schedule I am following. Currently, I spend my weekends converting my notes for this project, so new content is added as I go. Having a static format such as PDF or e-book would be cumbersome and would quickly become outdated. However, once the content reaches a more mature and stable state, other formats may become possible.

**Can I make my own PDF or e-book?**

For personal use. For further details see question "_Is this content really free?_" above.

**Will you offer night mode theme for this book**

Most likely no.
