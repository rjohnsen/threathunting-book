This notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to Threat Hunting, presented in a structured book format. Over the years, I’ve gained significant experience establishing SOC departments for Norwegian cybersecurity firms while actively working as a threat hunter.  

Now, as I transition into managing a Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC), I’m sharing my insights to help SOC analysts become effective threat hunters from the outset.
