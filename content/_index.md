# Threat Hunt Book

> Welcome to my notebook on Threat Hunting. This page serves as a compendium of my insights into Threat Hunting, presented in book format. After years of establishing SOC departments for several Norwegian cybersecurity firms while actively working as a threat hunter, I've chosen to share my notes and reflections on the craft of threat hunting. Now, as I transition into managing a Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC), I believe it's time to impart my perspective to empower SOC analysts to start as effective threat hunters from the outset.
