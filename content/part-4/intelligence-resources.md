**As threat hunters, access to reliable threat intelligence resources is crucial in our defenses against malicious activities. The following table is my personal and curated list of valuable tools and platforms that security professionals can leverage for various purposes, including threat detection, analysis, and response.**

**These resources encompass a range of functionalities, from IP reputation checks and malware analysis to community-driven threat intelligence sharing. By utilizing these platforms, we can gain insights into emerging threats, understand attacker methodologies, and enhance their overall security posture. Each entry in the table includes a clickable link to the resource, a brief description of its purpose, and its primary use case in the realm of cybersecurity.**

Many of these resources offers API's, or HTTP GET query arguments. If you know programming, you can easily make helper scripts to query multiple resources at the same time, and concatenate the results. This will save you valuable time. This is a route I have used many times and still find valuable. Some resources can also be plugged into your SIEM or SOAR, as well.
