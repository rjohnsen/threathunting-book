> In every great pursuit, there lies a humble beginning. We all have to start somewhere. For us, the journey begins with setting ourselves a standard, a beacon to guide us. It is this commitment to excellence that will transform us from novices into vigilant guardians, from learners into adept threat hunters. Each step we take fortifies our resolve, forging our path toward mastery and making the cyber world a safer place for all.

-- Roger C.B. Johnsen
