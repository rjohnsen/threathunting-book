### Chapter 3

# Models

> "When I began my journey as a SOC analyst, I was introduced to an SIEM. At that time, I had never heard of SIEMs; it was an enigma. Yet, I sat down and embarked on my SOC journey, learning from the ground up. Reflecting on my experiences, if I had to start over, I would prioritize understanding and leveraging models to navigate and comprehend complex situations more effectively. In this chapter, we will explore the significance of utilizing models in our work and how to apply them to enhance our capabilities and insights as threat hunters."
