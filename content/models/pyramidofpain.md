## About model

The Pyramid of Pain is a conceptual model created by David Bianco that illustrates the difficulty and impact of different types of indicators of compromise (IoCs) when defending against cyber threats. The model helps security professionals understand which types of IoCs will cause more pain to attackers when disrupted or denied. Here’s a depiction of the Pyramid of Pain and its components:

### Pyramid of Pain Components

1. **Hash Values** (Bottom of the Pyramid):
   - **Description**: Unique values generated by hash functions that correspond to specific files or pieces of data.
   - **Difficulty for Adversary**: Easy to change. Attackers can easily modify files to create different hash values.
   - **Impact**: Minimal. Blocking based on hash values only affects specific instances of malware.

2. **IP Addresses**:
   - **Description**: Internet Protocol addresses used by attackers' infrastructure.
   - **Difficulty for Adversary**: Moderately easy to change. Attackers can switch to different IP addresses or use dynamic DNS.
   - **Impact**: Low. Blocking IP addresses can disrupt attacks but is easily circumvented by attackers.

3. **Domain Names**:
   - **Description**: Domains used by attackers for command and control or to host malicious content.
   - **Difficulty for Adversary**: Moderately difficult to change. Requires acquiring and configuring new domains.
   - **Impact**: Medium. Blocking domains can disrupt communication channels but can be overcome with new domains.

4. **Network/Host Artifacts**:
   - **Description**: Specific patterns or signatures in network traffic or host activity that indicate malicious behavior.
   - **Difficulty for Adversary**: Harder to change. Attackers need to alter their tools and tactics.
   - **Impact**: Significant. Detecting and blocking these artifacts can effectively thwart ongoing attacks.

5. **Tools**:
   - **Description**: Software or scripts used by attackers to perform their operations.
   - **Difficulty for Adversary**: Hard to replace. Requires development or acquisition of new tools.
   - **Impact**: High. Disrupting tools can severely hamper an attacker’s capabilities.

6. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** (Top of the Pyramid):
   - **Description**: The overarching methods and approaches used by attackers.
   - **Difficulty for Adversary**: Very hard to change. Requires fundamental changes to how attackers operate.
   - **Impact**: Very high. Understanding and disrupting TTPs can prevent entire classes of attacks.

### Applications

The Pyramid of Pain is used by security professionals to prioritize their detection and mitigation efforts. By focusing on higher-level indicators such as TTPs, defenders can cause more significant disruption to attackers and improve their overall security posture.

## Example

A typical visual representation of the Pyramid of Pain shows the hierarchy of indicators with hash values at the bottom and TTPs at the top. Each layer represents an increase in difficulty for the adversary and impact on their operations when disrupted.
